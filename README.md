WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
WebSocket promotes real-time communication between the Client and the Web Server. It has the significant advantage of providing full-duplex communication over an HTTP connection. WebSocket also increases the accuracy and efficiency of stream events.


Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Socket.IO automatically upgrades the requirement to WebSocket if needed.
